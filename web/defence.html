        <p><span class="t_link"><a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/united-kingdom/what-we-do-uk-defence/squadnet">Squadnet</a></span><br />
        <span class="t_review">SquadNet is more than just a radio. A built-in, high sensitivity GPS receiver provides a situational awareness capability. This position data can be securely transmitted, via Bluetooth, to an Android device to enable users to see not only their position, but also that of their comrades-in-arms. The Android app that provides this functionality also enables soldiers to take advantage of IP networks such as 3G, LTE or Wi-Fi to employ a web-bridge capability, further expanding their scope of operations. This powerful feature has the potential to transform dismounted infantry from dispersed and disconnected squads to fully networked and co-ordinated operators on the battlefield.</span></p>
