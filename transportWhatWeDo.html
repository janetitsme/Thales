AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF TRANSPORTATION SOLUTIONS

A world leader in electronics and security systems, we build on our expertise to provide solutions that set the standard in the transportation industry. We help you get the most out of your infrastructure. 

In 1986, we deployed the first Communications Based-Train Control (CBTC) signalling system on Vancouver’s driverless metro. Since then, we have gained more experience with this solution than any other manufacturer in the world by:

Providing over 30 metros with our SelTrac® solution
Cumulating over 100 million hours of operation to our credit 
 

We also supplied Spain, operator of the world’s largest high-speed rail network, with 50 per cent of all its interlocking systems, ETCS signalling solutions and communication system.

Thanks to our commitment to innovation, we are ranked: 

#1 leader in Europe with European Train Control System (ETCS) trackside systems
#1 worldwide in Communications-Based Train Control systems (CBTC)
#2 worldwide in integration communication and supervision systems for transportation networks
